# Digital-Signal-and-Image-Management
A repository of assignments and project performed during the Advanced Machine Learning course. 

## 1. Audio Classification
[Audio Classification Folder](Assignment1-AudioClassification/)

The assignment consists in the implementation of an SVM that classify one-dimensional audio signals through the Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) feature. This feature extract the number of sign changes present in a mono-channel signal. The goal is to predict the number spoken from the audio file and its characteristics.

The provided dataset is made up of 1500 wav files in which three different subjects pronounce the numbers from 0 to 9. Each file contains the pronunciation of a single number, and each subject pronounces each number fifty times.
